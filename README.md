## Task Description
The objective of this task is to choose a popular mobile application and redesign its UI/UX to address a specific usability pain point.

---

## Selected Application
**Cofeen – Coffee Shop Mobile App**

---

## Identified Pain Point
The original interface contained multiple promotional elements and densely packed components, which reduced clarity and made it harder for users to quickly focus on key actions such as browsing products and placing orders.

---

## Redesign Approach
The redesign focuses on improving usability by refining spacing, enhancing typography readability, and strengthening visual hierarchy. Primary actions such as ordering and navigation were emphasized, while unnecessary visual clutter was reduced. The redesign maintains the original brand identity and color palette to ensure familiarity for users.
